#### Asia

Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by the Far East â€“ the mystery, the history, the culture. So when I had the opportunity to travel to Japan, China and Thailand, I jumped at the chance.

I started my journey in **Japan**, a country that is both ultra-modern and steeped in tradition. I was amazed by the contrast of the cities and the countryside. In Tokyo, I visited the bustling markets and skyscrapers, while in Kyoto I was transported back in time with its temples and traditional Japanese gardens.

I also loved the food in Japan â€“ from sushi and sashimi to ramen and yakitori, there was so much to try. I was also lucky enough to experience a traditional tea ceremony, which was a real highlight.

Next, I headed to **China**. This was my first time in Asia, and I was struck by the size and scale of the country. I visited Beijing, home to the Great Wall of China and the Forbidden City, and also ventured out to the rural areas, where I saw farmers working in the fields and kids playing in the streets.

The food in China was also incredible â€“ from street food to fine dining, I was spoilt for choice. I also loved the traditional Chinese medicine, which was a real eye-opener.

Finally, I ended my trip in **Thailand**. This was a real contrast to China, and I loved the laid-back atmosphere and the beautiful beaches. I also experienced some of the best food of my trip here, from curries to pad Thai.

**What to expect on safari in Africa**

When you're on safari in Africa, you can expect to spend most of your time driving around in a vehicle, so you'll want to be prepared for long days in the sun. You'll also want to be prepared for early mornings, as many safari tours start before dawn.

During your safari, you'll likely have the opportunity to go on game drives, where you'll search for wildlife in the bush. You might also go on a walking safari, where you'll explore the wilderness on foot with a guide.

No matter what type of safari you go on, you're sure to have an unforgettable experience.
