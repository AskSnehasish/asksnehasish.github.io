# Making Notes in Craft

> **::Hello and welcome!::**

> Writing should be fun, simple and writing tools should get out of the way. Craft is there to make this happen and help you â€˜Craftâ€™ your document.



### Letâ€™s get started with a todo list

There are 3 different ways to do things in Craft and **::you can choose whichever is easier for you.::**

Weâ€™ll illustrate this with a checkbox

- [ ] **The menu.** Select this block of text, find the checkbox option in the righthand menu (under `Aa`) and see how it adds or removes the todo styling.
- [ ] **The Forward slash.** Typing `/` anywhere in the document will bring up the quick menu and will apply styling without ever leaving the keyboard. ::Try typing  `/` right hereâ€¦::
- [ ] **Markdown.** For many commands Craft uses markdown and keyboard shortcuts. For example to create a todo item simply start a new line, type `x` and then a `space`. Tada ðŸŽ‰
- [X] Craft checkboxes have a superpower, they can show an item that won't be done with a double tap. Just like this one



### Daily notes

Daily notes are a great place for making quick notes or adding meeting notes. Youâ€™ll find them under the calendar icon.

While daily notes can do everything a normal document can do they also have some extra functions to help with managing your time.

- [ ] You can link to a daily note by typing `@` and then the date or [Fri 28 Oct](day://2022.10.28)
- [ ] You can also [connect your calendar](link to help page) and add meeting notes.
